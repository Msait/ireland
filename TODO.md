1. Uploading tours on management module in csv format. Different tour providers expect. Process uploading should have statistics, e.g:

Job | Provider | start uploading (date) | end | Description
--- | -------- | ---------------------- | --- | -----------
Tour uploading job | (grawler site) | 19:40 12.23.2015 | 19:45 12.23.2015 | Upload tours into DB from some provider

2. Statistic tab on management. Should include: user actions (except users with ROLE_USER :) ). Eg:

User | Action | Date
---- | ------ | ----
Ted  | Update profile image | 23.02.2015
